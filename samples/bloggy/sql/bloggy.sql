(1, 1, 'About me', 'Newton was a fellow of Trinity College and the second Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge. He was a devout but unorthodox Christian who privately rejected the doctrine of the Trinity. Unusually for a member of the Cambridge faculty of the day, he refused to take holy orders in the Church of England. Beyond his work on the mathematical sciences, Newton dedicated much of his time to the study of alchemy and biblical chronology, but most of his work in those areas remained unpublished until long after his death. Politically and personally tied to the Whig party, Newton served two brief terms as Member of Parliament for the University of Cambridge, in 1689–90 and 1701–02. He was knighted by Queen Anne in 1705 and spent the last three decades of his life in London, serving as Warden (1696–1700) and Master (1700–1727) of the Royal Mint, as well as president of the Royal Society (1703–1727).', 0, '2019-05-05 18:26:46', '2019-05-06 00:26:46'),

The rest of Christopher Robin Milne\'s toys – Piglet, Eeyore, Kanga, Roo, and Tigger – were incorporated into Milne\'s stories.[2][3] Two more characters, Owl and Rabbit, were created by Milne\'s imagination, while Gopher was added to the Disney version. Christopher Robin\'s toy bear is on display at the Main Branch of the New York Public Library in New York City.[4]\r\n\r\n\r\nHarry Colebourn and Winnie, 1914\r\nChristopher Milne had named his toy bear after Winnie, a Canadian black bear he often saw at London Zoo, and \"Pooh\", a swan they had met while on holiday. The bear cub was purchased from a hunter for $20 by Canadian Lieutenant Harry Colebourn in White River, Ontario, Canada, while en route to England during the First World War.[5] He named the bear \"Winnie\" after his adopted hometown in Winnipeg, Manitoba. \"Winnie\" was surreptitiously brought to England with her owner, and gained unofficial recognition as The Fort Garry Horse regimental mascot. Colebourn left Winnie at the London Zoo while he and his unit were in France; after the war she was officially donated to the zoo, as she had become a much-loved attraction there.[6] Pooh the swan appears as a character in its own right in When We Were Very Young.\r\n\r\n\r\nStatue in Winnipeg of Harry Colebourn and Winnie\r\nIn the first chapter of Winnie-the-Pooh, Milne offers this explanation of why Winnie-the-Pooh is often called simply \"Pooh\":\r\n\r\nBut his arms were so stiff ... they stayed up straight in the air for more than a week, and whenever a fly came and settled on his nose he had to blow it off. And I think – but I am not sure – that that is why he is always called Pooh.\r\n\r\nThe American writer William Safire surmised that the Milnes\' invention of the name \"Winnie the Pooh\" may have also been influenced by the haughty character Pooh-Bah in Gilbert and Sullivan\'s The Mikado (1885).[7]', 0, '2019-05-05 18:27:49', '2019-05-06 00:27:49'),
(3, 2, 'Work', 'From this work, he concluded that the lens of any refracting telescope would suffer from the dispersion of light into colours (chromatic aberration). As a proof of the concept, he constructed a telescope using reflective mirrors instead of lenses as the objective to bypass that problem.[45][46] Building the design, the first known functional reflecting telescope, today known as a Newtonian telescope,[46] involved solving the problem of a suitable mirror material and shaping technique. Newton ground his own mirrors out of a custom composition of highly reflective speculum metal, using Newton\'s rings to judge the quality of the optics for his telescopes. In late 1668,[47] he was able to produce this first reflecting telescope. It was about eight inches long and it gave a clearer and larger image. In 1671, the Royal Society asked for a demonstration of his reflecting telescope.[48] Their interest encouraged him to publish his notes, Of Colours,[49] which he later expanded into the work Opticks. When Robert Hooke criticised some of Newton\'s ideas, Newton was so offended that he withdrew from public debate. Newton and Hooke had brief exchanges in 1679–80, when Hooke, appointed to manage the Royal Society\'s correspondence, opened up a correspondence intended to elicit contributions from Newton to Royal Society transactions,[50] which had the effect of stimulating Newton to work out a proof that the elliptical form of planetary orbits would result from a centripetal force inversely proportional to the square of the radius vector. But the two men remained generally on poor terms until Hooke\'s death.[51]\r\n\r\n\r\nFacsimile of a 1682 letter from Isaac Newton to Dr William Briggs, commenting on Briggs\' A New Theory of Vision.\r\nNewton argued that light is composed of particles or corpuscles, which were refracted by accelerating into a denser medium. He verged on soundlike waves to explain the repeated pattern of reflection and transmission by thin films (Opticks Bk.II, Props. 12), but still retained his theory of \'fits\' that disposed corpuscles to be reflected or transmitted (Props.13). However, later physicists favoured a purely wavelike explanation of light to account for the interference patterns and the general phenomenon of diffraction. Today\'s quantum mechanics, photons, and the idea of wave–particle duality bear only a minor resemblance to Newton\'s understanding of light.\r\n\r\nIn his Hypothesis of Light of 1675, Newton posited the existence of the ether to transmit forces between particles. The contact with the Cambridge Platonist philosopher Henry More revived his interest in alchemy.[52] He replaced the ether with occult forces based on Hermetic ideas of attraction and repulsion between particles. John Maynard Keynes, who acquired many of Newton\'s writings on alchemy, stated that \"Newton was not the first of the age of reason: He was the last of the magicians.\"[53] Newton\'s interest in alchemy cannot be isolated from his contributions to science.[52] This was at a time when there was no clear distinction between alchemy and science. Had he not relied on the occult idea of action at a distance, across a vacuum, he might not have developed his theory of gravity.\r\n\r\nIn 1704, Newton published Opticks, in which he expounded his corpuscular theory of light. He considered light to be made up of extremely subtle corpuscles, that ordinary matter was made of grosser corpuscles and speculated that through a kind of alchemical transmutation \"Are not gross Bodies and Light convertible into one another, ... and may not Bodies receive much of their Activity from the Particles of Light which enter their Composition?\"[54] Newton also constructed a primitive form of a frictional electrostatic generator, using a glass globe.[55]\r\n\r\nIn an article entitled \"Newton, prisms, and the \'opticks\' of tunable lasers\"[56] it is indicated that Newton in his book Opticks was the first to show a diagram using a prism as a beam expander. In the same book he describes, via diagrams, the use of multiple-prism arrays. Some 278 years after Newton\'s discussion, multiple-prism beam expanders became central to the development of narrow-linewidth tunable lasers. Also, the use of these prismatic beam expanders led to the multiple-prism dispersion theory.[56]\r\n\r\n\r\n', 0, '2019-05-05 18:28:05', '2019-05-06 00:28:05'),
(4, 1, 'Religious views', 'Although born into an Anglican family, by his thirties Newton held a Christian faith that, had it been made public, would not have been considered orthodox by mainstream Christianity;[114] in recent times he has been described as a heretic.[69]\r\n\r\nBy 1672 he had started to record his theological researches in notebooks which he showed to no one and which have only recently been examined. They demonstrate an extensive knowledge of early church writings and show that in the conflict between Athanasius and Arius which defined the Creed, he took the side of Arius, the loser, who rejected the conventional view of the Trinity. Newton \"recognized Christ as a divine mediator between God and man, who was subordinate to the Father who created him.\"[115] He was especially interested in prophecy, but for him, \"the great apostasy was trinitarianism.\"[116]\r\n\r\nNewton tried unsuccessfully to obtain one of the two fellowships that exempted the holder from the ordination requirement. At the last moment in 1675 he received a dispensation from the government that excused him and all future holders of the Lucasian chair.[117]\r\n\r\nIn Newton\'s eyes, worshipping Christ as God was idolatry, to him the fundamental sin. [118] Historian Stephen D. Snobelen says, \"Isaac Newton was a heretic. But ... he never made a public declaration of his private faith—which the orthodox would have deemed extremely radical. He hid his faith so well that scholars are still unravelling his personal beliefs.\"[69] Snobelen concludes that Newton was at least a Socinian sympathiser (he owned and had thoroughly read at least eight Socinian books), possibly an Arian and almost certainly an anti-trinitarian.[69]\r\n\r\nIn a minority position, T.C. Pfizenmaier offers a more nuanced view, arguing that Newton held closer to the Semi-Arian view of the Trinity that Jesus Christ was of a \"similar substance\" (homoiousios) from the Father rather than the orthodox view that Jesus Christ is of the \"same substance\" of the Father (homoousios) as endorsed by modern Eastern Orthodox, Roman Catholics and Protestants.[119] However, this type of view \'has lost support of late with the availability of Newton\'s theological papers\',[120] and now most scholars identify Newton as an Antitrinitarian monotheist.[69][121]\r\n\r\nAlthough the laws of motion and universal gravitation became Newton\'s best-known discoveries, he warned against using them to view the Universe as a mere machine, as if akin to a great clock. He said, \"Gravity explains the motions of the planets, but it cannot explain who set the planets in motion. God governs all things and knows all that is or can be done.\"[122]\r\n\r\nAlong with his scientific fame, Newton\'s studies of the Bible and of the early Church Fathers were also noteworthy. Newton wrote works on textual criticism, most notably An Historical Account of Two Notable Corruptions of Scripture and Observations upon the Prophecies of Daniel, and the Apocalypse of St. John.[123] He placed the crucifixion of Jesus Christ at 3 April, AD 33, which agrees with one traditionally accepted date.[124]\r\n\r\nHe believed in a rationally immanent world, but he rejected the hylozoism implicit in Leibniz and Baruch Spinoza. The ordered and dynamically informed Universe could be understood, and must be understood, by an active reason. In his correspondence, Newton claimed that in writing the Principia \"I had an eye upon such Principles as might work with considering men for the belief of a Deity\".[125] He saw evidence of design in the system of the world: \"Such a wonderful uniformity in the planetary system must be allowed the effect of choice\". But Newton insisted that divine intervention would eventually be required to reform the system, due to the slow growth of instabilities.[126] For this, Leibniz lampooned him: \"God Almighty wants to wind up his watch from time to time: otherwise it would cease to move. He had not, it seems, sufficient foresight to make it a perpetual motion.\"[127]\r\n\r\nNewton\'s position was vigorously defended by his follower Samuel Clarke in a famous correspondence. A century later, Pierre-Simon Laplace\'s work \"Celestial Mechanics\" had a natural explanation for why the planet orbits do not require periodic divine intervention.[128]', 0, '2019-05-05 18:28:50', '2019-05-06 00:28:50'),
(5, 2, 'Merchandising revenue dispute', 'Pooh videos, soft toys and other merchandise generate substantial annual revenues for Disney. The size of Pooh stuffed toys ranges from Beanie and miniature to human-sized. In addition to the stylised Disney Pooh, Disney markets Classic Pooh merchandise which more closely resembles E.H. Shepard\'s illustrations.\r\n\r\nIn 1991, Stephen Slesinger, Inc. filed a lawsuit against Disney which alleged that Disney had breached their 1983 agreement by again failing to accurately report revenue from Winnie the Pooh sales. Under this agreement, Disney was to retain approximately 98% of gross worldwide revenues while the remaining 2% was to be paid to Slesinger. In addition, the suit alleged that Disney had failed to pay required royalties on all commercial exploitation of the product name.[24] Though the Disney corporation was sanctioned by a judge for destroying forty boxes of evidential documents,[25] the suit was later terminated by another judge when it was discovered that Slesinger\'s investigator had rummaged through Disney\'s garbage to retrieve the discarded evidence.[26] Slesinger appealed the termination and, on 26 September 2007, a three-judge panel upheld the lawsuit dismissal.[27]\r\n\r\nAfter the Copyright Term Extension Act of 1998, Clare Milne, Christopher Milne\'s daughter, attempted to terminate any future U.S. copyrights for Stephen Slesinger, Inc.[28] After a series of legal hearings, Judge Florence-Marie Cooper of the U.S. District Court in California found in favour of Stephen Slesinger, Inc., as did the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. On 26 June 2006, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear the case, sustaining the ruling and ensuring the defeat of the suit.[29]\r\n\r\nOn 19 February 2007 Disney lost a court case in Los Angeles which ruled their \"misguided claims\" to dispute the licensing agreements with Slesinger, Inc. were unjustified,[30] but a federal ruling of 28 September 2009, again from Judge Florence-Marie Cooper, determined that the Slesinger family had granted all trademarks and copyrights to Disney, although Disney must pay royalties for all future use of the characters.
